ABSTRACT
The use of renewable sources of power has been greatly encouraged since the turn of the century, 
owing to the limited source of fossil fuels and its devastating effects on the environment. The richest 
fuel source in the area of renewable energy is solar energy, which is considered to be by far the most 
reliable clean energy source there is.
 
 In that light, our work focuses on the fabrication and testing of a portable solar powered charging 
station, all while utilizing the effectiveness of the dual-axis solar tracking system concept in the output 
voltage and current of the prototype. Locally available materials were used in constructing the 
prototype, while all functions were managed by Arduino UNO microcontroller.
